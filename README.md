# inventorymanagementsystem



Technologies used: Laravel, ReactJs and mySql

How I approached building the project:
I started by building Reactjs app where I designed the User Interface, I used bootsrap in Reactjs for quick design. Then I built laravel app and started coding the CRUD APIs and connecting it to mysql. Then I completed on the front end by calling the CRUD Apis where necessary. 
I used Postman to test my APIs. 
Stuff I need to work more on: 
Design 
Complete the whole features
